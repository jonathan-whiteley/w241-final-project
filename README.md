How can individuals become more motivated to donate to cancer research? Do positive or negative stories about cancer treatments help get more people interested in donating to cancer research? These are questions we set out to explore in this field experiment. We were interested in understanding the impact of presenting negative or positive messages on peopleâ€™s willingness to donate to cancer research.
